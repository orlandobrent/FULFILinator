# 🚚 FULFILinator

> *"Behold! The FULFILinator! It tracks every purchase order, every order, every delivery — with an iron grip! No item shall slip through the cracks of the Tri-State Area's supply chain!"*

Order fulfillment tracking system for the complete **PO → Order → Delivery** pipeline. Part of the [Inator Platform](https://github.com/losomode/inator) family.

**Admins** manage the full lifecycle — creating POs, placing orders, shipping deliveries, tracking serial numbers. **Customers** get clear visibility into what's been ordered, what's shipped, and what's left.

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    PO[📜 Purchase Order<br/><i>Customer commits to buy N items</i>]
    ORD[📦 Order<br/><i>Fulfill from one or more POs</i>]
    DEL[🚚 Delivery<br/><i>Ship with serial numbers</i>]

    PO -->|allocate| ORD
    ORD -->|ship| DEL

    style PO fill:#3498db,color:#fff
    style ORD fill:#e67e22,color:#fff
    style DEL fill:#27ae60,color:#fff
```

Each step updates the one before it. Deliver 5 of 10 items? The order knows. The PO knows. Everyone knows. No spreadsheets. No guessing.

### The Fulfillment Pipeline

        CREATE_PO[Create PO<br/><i>Items, quantities, prices</i>]
        TRACK_PO[Track Fulfillment<br/><i>Ordered / Remaining / Waived</i>]
        CLOSE_PO[Close PO<br/><i>All items fulfilled or waived</i>]
    end

    subgraph "Order Management"
        CREATE_ORD[Create Order<br/><i>Auto-allocate from oldest PO</i>]
        TRACK_ORD[Track Deliveries<br/><i>Shipped / Remaining</i>]
        CLOSE_ORD[Close Order<br/><i>All items delivered</i>]
    end

    subgraph "Delivery Management"
        CREATE_DEL[Create Delivery<br/><i>Link to order, assign serials</i>]
        SHIP[Ship<br/><i>Tracking number + serial per item</i>]
        CLOSE_DEL[Close Delivery<br/><i>Confirmed received</i>]
    end

    CREATE_PO --> TRACK_PO
    TRACK_PO --> CLOSE_PO
    CREATE_ORD --> TRACK_ORD
    TRACK_ORD --> CLOSE_ORD
    CREATE_DEL --> SHIP --> CLOSE_DEL

| Layer | Stack |
|-------|-------|
| Backend | Python 3.11+, Django + DRF, SQLite (port **8003**) |
| Frontend | TypeScript (strict), React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS (unified SPA) |
| Auth | JWT via [Authinator](https://github.com/losomode/AUTHinator) |
| Testing | pytest + coverage (backend), Vitest + RTL (frontend) |
| Task Runner | [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) |

## Quick Start

Requires Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+, and [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) (`brew install go-task`).

### Platform Mode (Recommended)

If you're using the [Inator Platform](https://github.com/losomode/inator):

```bash
# From the platform root (inator/)
task setup           # Sets up all inators including Fulfilinator
task start:all       # Starts all services + unified frontend + gateway

# Access at http://localhost:8080
```

### Standalone Mode

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/losomode/FULFILinator.git
cd Fulfilinator

# Install dependencies
task install

# Configure environment
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env to set AUTHINATOR_API_URL and other settings

# Setup database
task backend:migrate

# Start backend (port 8003)
task backend:dev

# In another terminal — start frontend (port 3003, standalone only)
task frontend:dev
```

**Note**: When running via the Inator Platform, the frontend is served from the unified SPA at `inator/frontend/`. The standalone frontend is only for isolated development.

### Troubleshooting Fresh Installs

If services fail to start, check:

```bash
# Verify .env exists
ls -la backend/.env

# Run migrations if database doesn't exist
task backend:migrate

# Check that dependencies installed correctly
ls -la .venv/                    # Backend venv should exist
ls -la frontend/node_modules/    # Frontend deps should exist

# View logs if running via platform orchestrator
tail -50 /path/to/logs/Fulfilinator-backend.log
tail -50 /path/to/logs/Fulfilinator-frontend.log
```

### Task Reference

```bash
task                      # List all tasks
task check                # Pre-commit: fmt + lint + test + coverage
task test:coverage        # All tests with ≥85% coverage gate
task build                # Production frontend build
task db:reset             # ⚠️  Nuclear option — wipes the database
task stats                # Project statistics
```

## Key Features

🔄 **Automatic PO Allocation** — Orders draw from the oldest PO first, respecting quantities and contracted prices. PO-1 at $2,000/unit gets consumed before PO-2 at $2,100/unit. No manual bookkeeping.

🚫 **Over-delivery Prevention** — You can't ship more than was ordered. The system enforces quantity limits per order line item across all deliveries.

🔢 **Serial Number Tracking** — Every physical item in a delivery gets a unique serial number. Duplicates are rejected. Search any serial to find its delivery instantly.

✨ **Quantity Waiving** — Customer only wants 8 of 10 units? Admins can waive the remainder with a reason, letting POs close cleanly without phantom inventory.

🔓 **Admin Override Close** — When items remain but the PO needs to close, admins can force it with a justification. The system confirms before proceeding.

⚠️ **Field-Level Validation** — API errors highlight the exact form field that failed. No more guessing which of your 12 line items has a blank serial number.

📎 **Attachments** — Upload files to POs, Orders, or Deliveries. Link Google Docs and HubSpot deals on POs.

🔒 **Multi-Tenant Isolation** — Customers see only their own data. Admins see everything.

🎨 **Unified UI** — Integrated into the platform's single-page React app with dark/light mode support.

## Roles

| Role | Scope |
|------|-------|
| **SYSTEM_ADMIN** | Full access to all data and features across all customers |
| **CUSTOMER_ADMIN** | Manage users and data within their customer account |
| **CUSTOMER_USER** | View and edit their customer's POs, orders, and deliveries |
| **CUSTOMER_READONLY** | View-only access to their customer's data |

Roles come from the JWT issued by [Authinator](https://github.com/losomode/AUTHinator). FULFILinator never stores credentials.

## API

All endpoints live under `/api/fulfil/` and require a valid JWT (except health check). Full OpenAPI docs available at `/api/fulfil/docs/`.

## Environment

Create `backend/.env`:

```env
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
AUTHINATOR_API_URL=http://localhost:8001/api/auth/
AUTHINATOR_VERIFY_SSL=False
```

For Docker, set `SQLITE_PATH=/app/backend/data/db.sqlite3` so data persists in the named volume.

## 🌐 Deployment

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

FULFILinator ships with a `Dockerfile` and is orchestrated by the [Inator Platform](https://github.com/losomode/inator) via Docker Compose.

#### Development

```bash
# From the platform root (inator/)
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

SQLite data persists in the `fulfilinator_data` named volume at `/app/backend/data/db.sqlite3`.

Useful commands inside the dev container:

```bash
# Migrations (run automatically on startup, but can be forced)
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec fulfilinator python backend/manage.py migrate

# Create superuser
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec fulfilinator python backend/manage.py createsuperuser
```

#### Production

```bash
# 1. Create .env.prod from the example
cp backend/.env.prod.example backend/.env.prod
# Edit backend/.env.prod: set SECRET_KEY, ALLOWED_HOSTS, SMTP, etc.

# 2. From the platform root — set domain/TLS vars
export DEPLOY_DOMAIN=yourapp.com
export CADDY_ACME_EMAIL=you@yourapp.com

# 3. Build and start
task docker:prod:build
task docker:prod:up
```

In production, the **React frontend is compiled and baked into the Caddy image** (no frontend container). Caddy handles TLS automatically via Let’s Encrypt. Migrations run automatically on startup.

See the platform [docker-compose.dev.yml](https://github.com/losomode/inator/blob/main/docker-compose.dev.yml) and [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/losomode/inator/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) for the full configuration.

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Copy `backend/.env.prod.example` → `backend/.env.prod` and fill in all values
- [ ] Set `DEBUG=False`
- [ ] Configure strong `SECRET_KEY` (50+ chars)
- [ ] Set `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to your domain
- [ ] Configure Authinator connection (`AUTHINATOR_API_URL`)
- [ ] Set `SQLITE_PATH=/app/backend/data/db.sqlite3` (Docker volume path)
- [ ] Set `DEPLOY_DOMAIN` and `CADDY_ACME_EMAIL` env vars before building
- [ ] Ensure ports 80 and 443 are open on your server
- [ ] Run `task docker:prod:build && task docker:prod:up` from platform root

> *"You know, people always ask me why I track every single delivery down to the serial number. And I say — because once, a package meant for me ended up at my brother Roger's house. ROGER! He got my Fully Automatic Bubble Wrap Popper and I got nothing! NOTHING! That's why the FULFILinator exists. No package shall ever go astray again!"*
